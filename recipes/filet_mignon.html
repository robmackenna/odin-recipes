    <p> Yummy filet mignon recipe for two people</p>

    <h3>Ingedients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2 (6 ounce) filet mignon steaks</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon olive oil</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
        <li>1 shallot, minced</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>4 ounces crumbled Gorgonzola cheese</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Place a large, oven-proof skillet in the oven as it preheats.</li>
        <li>Bring steaks to room temperature. Rub with olive oil and season generously with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Remove the hot skillet from the oven carefully and place it on a burner set to high heat. Leave the oven on.</li>
        <li>Place steaks into the dry pan immediately and sear, turning with tongs, 1 to 2 minutes on both sides.</li>
        <li>Transfer the pan back into the preheated oven and cook until desired doneness is reached, 3 to 5 minutes. For medium doneness, an instant-read thermometer inserted into the centers should read 140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Transfer steaks to a warm platter and tent loosely with foil. Let rest for 5 to 10 minutes; the steaks will continue to cook during this process and the internal temperature will rise 5 to 10 degrees.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add shallot and garlic and saute until shallot is tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour in cream; let cook until reduced by half, about 10 minutes. Turn heat to low and add Gorgonzola cheese. Let cheese melt; season with salt and pepper. Serve sauce with steaks.</li>
    </ol>
